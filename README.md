# Running:
#### Everything is very simple.
1. [Download the latest builder from the release](https://github.com/Sigma-cc/Dead-video/releases/), then unpack the archive.
2. Move your video to the folder with the builder.
3. Run `dead-video.exe`, 
4. In the first field enter the name of your video(with .mp4), and in the second - the name of the video that will be the result.
5. You can click on the "Build Video" button!

Done, now you can share the *broken* video with your friends.
